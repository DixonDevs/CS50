"What ultimately matters in this course is not so much where you end up relatve to your classmates,
but where you end up to your self relative to where you began".

Computer Science:

What is it? - The study of information.
 - Problem Solving is a goal using computational thinking. 

 - input -> (problem to be solved) -> output


Computational Language ----------------------
 Unary Notation - base-1
 Binary Notation - base-2
 Binary Digit - is a bit either a 0 or 1
 Byte is 8bits


 Psudocode: 
 1. Pick up phone book
 2. open to middle of phone book
 3. Look at page
 4. if person is on page    
        Call person
 5. Else if person is earlier in book 
    Open to middle of left half of book
        Go back to step 3
 6. if person is person is later in book
    Open to middle of right half of book
        Go back to step 3
 7. Else
        Quit


What we will be talking about soon: 

Functions
Conditionals
Boolean Expressions
Loops


Artificial Intellegence -------------------------------
Large Language Model - Implementation of code that uses lots of lots of text from websites
and infers from the patters of any type of language to answer the question.

So its software that infers waht it should say probablistically.
